Lamhe is not just a movie, but a phenomenon that has influenced generations of filmmakers and viewers. The film broke many stereotypes and conventions of Hindi cinema and explored themes such as age gap, reincarnation, forbidden love and social stigma. The film was ahead of its time and faced some resistance from the Indian audience, who were not ready for such a bold and unconventional story. However, the film was a huge success overseas, especially in the UK, where it became one of the most popular Bollywood films of all time.
 
Lamhe also marked the second and final collaboration between Yash Chopra and Sridevi, who had previously worked together in Chandni (1989). Sridevi delivered one of her career-best performances in Lamhe, playing the dual roles of Pallavi and Pooja with grace and versatility. She effortlessly switched between the mature and dignified Pallavi and the bubbly and vivacious Pooja, creating two distinct and memorable characters. She also showcased her dancing skills in the song "Morni Baga Ma Bole", which is considered one of her iconic dance numbers. Sridevi's performance in Lamhe is widely regarded as one of the finest in Indian cinema history.
 
Lamhe also featured a stellar supporting cast, including Waheeda Rehman as Pallavi's mother, Anupam Kher as Viren's friend and comic relief, and Deepak Malhotra as Pallavi's husband. The film also introduced Dippy Sagoo as Anita, Viren's fiancÃ©e, who later became a popular TV actress. The film also had a cameo appearance by Ila Arun as a Rajasthani folk singer.
