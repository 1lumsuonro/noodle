# Damodarastakam: A Devotional Song to Lord Krishna in Malayalam
 
Damodarastakam is a Sanskrit hymn composed by Satyavrata Muni, a great devotee of Lord Krishna. It describes the pastime of Krishna being bound by a rope to a wooden grinding mortar by his mother Yashoda, who wanted to punish him for stealing butter. The name Damodara means "one who has a rope around his belly".
 
The hymn consists of eight verses, each ending with the refrain "namami nanda-nandana", meaning "I bow down to the son of Nanda". It is traditionally sung during the month of Kartika (October-November), which is also known as Damodara month, when devotees offer lamps to Krishna and meditate on his childhood pastimes.

    I bow down to the Supreme Lord, who has an eternal form of bliss and knowledge,
    who wears shining earrings, and who is splendidly manifest in Gokula.
    He was bound by his mother Yashoda with a rope to a wooden grinding mortar,
    and thus he is known as Damodara, the one who gives joy to his devotees.

## Damodarastakam Meaning in Malayalam
 
The meaning of each verse of Damodarastakam is briefly explained below:
 
1. The first verse praises Krishna's transcendental form, which is full of eternity, knowledge and bliss. He wears beautiful earrings that sparkle in Gokula, the land of cows. He was tied by his mother Yashoda with a rope to a wooden grinding mortar as a punishment for stealing butter. This pastime reveals his supreme sweetness and mercy, as he allows himself to be controlled by his pure devotees.
2. The second verse describes how Krishna broke two pots of yogurt with his friends and ate the butter. When Yashoda came to catch him, he ran away in fear and hid behind a mortar. Yashoda followed him and caught him by his hair. She saw his fearful eyes filled with tears and decided to bind him with a rope. But she found that the rope was always two fingers short, no matter how much she tried. This shows that Krishna can only be bound
3. The third verse glorifies Krishna's childhood pastimes, which drown the residents of Gokula in pools of ecstasy. He reveals to his devotees who know his supreme majesty and opulence that he is only conquered by their pure love, which is free from awe and reverence. The devotee offers his repeated obeisances to Krishna with great love.
4. The fourth verse expresses the devotee's desire to attain Krishna's pure love, which is more valuable than liberation or any other benediction. He does not want anything else but to see Krishna's beautiful form as a cowherd boy in Gokula, which is the source of all happiness.
5. The fifth verse describes the beauty of Krishna's lotus face, which is surrounded by dark curly hair and moistened by the gopis' kisses. His lips are red like bimba fruits and his eyes are restless like bees. The devotee says that this face is always present in his mind and he does not care for millions of other attractions.
6. The sixth verse offers obeisances to Krishna as Damodara, the unlimited Lord who is the source of everything. He prays to him to be merciful and rescue him from the ocean of material suffering. He begs him to accept him as his own servant and show him his lotus eyes.
7. The seventh verse refers to the pastime of Krishna freeing the two sons of Kuvera, Nalakuvara and Manigriva, who were cursed by Narada Muni to become trees. Krishna broke the mortar that he was tied to and knocked down the two trees, thus liberating them and granting them devotion. The devotee prays to Krishna to grant him the same kind of prema-bhakti, pure love for him, and says that he has no desire for liberation or any other goal.
8. The eighth verse again offers obeisances to Krishna as Damodara, who is bound by a rope around his belly. He also offers obeisances to his mother Yashoda, who tied him with her love. He also offers obeisances to Radhika, his most beloved consort, and to his unlimited pastimes, which are full of wonder and sweetness.
